If using an oven, pierce a few times with a sharp knife or the tines of a fork, rub with olive oil and bake in a 400¬∞F oven for about an hour until the potatoes are cooked through and give a little when pressed. If using a microwave, pierce the potato a few times with a sharp knife of the tines of a fork, rub all over with olive oil and cook on the high setting for about 5 minutes per potato. I have found that baking the potatoes in a conventional oven yields potatoes that are easier to work with (cut and scoop out), the potato seems to adhere to the skins a little better, but there is hardly a discernible difference in the final product."

I didn't remove much of the potato (per my daughter's request...if I were making them just for myself I'd remove almost all and load them with cheese and bacon!!), and I let myself run out of olive oil so I used cooking spray. They turned out crispy and amazing even with the extra potato. The ten min at 450 on each side made all the difference from the recipes I've tried before. AND the sprinkling of salt was perfect üòÅ\nThank you for sharing!"
